# README

This is a Rails 4.2.5 application on Ruby 2.0.0, designed for learning about
Exercises for Programmers, 39 and 40: **sorting and filtering records**

Goal is to learn more about pushing a Rails app out into the wild, without
using Heroku. For this, [openshift](https://openshift.com) is the goal.

## Openshift Support

Once a gear was setup, merging in the git directories from
https://github.com/trueheart78/puma-openshift
became mandatory, for Puma support (instead of Passenger).
